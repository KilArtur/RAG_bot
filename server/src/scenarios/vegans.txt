I regularly think about how my choices today will affect my life years from now.
How likely are you to work much harder this week for benefits you will feel many years later?
To follow your diet plan that benefits you only decades later, you need to miss a major social event. How likely are you to do it?
In an emergency, I would break my own dietary rules to prevent serious harm to someone else. How likely are you to do it?
When others mock my choices, how strong was your emotional reaction?
