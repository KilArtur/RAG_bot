In the last 5 days, I completed tasks at about the pace I expected.
At times, I found myself checking instructions more than once.
I felt able to keep track of all the steps needed for my tasks.
Some tasks required more steps than I first thought.
I could shift smoothly between different apps or tasks.
I needed to re-open work I had already marked as done.
After meetings, I returned quickly to focused work.
I sometimes noticed simple tasks taking longer than expected.
I usually wrapped up tasks without needing extra recovery time.
On some days, I paused before starting tasks I normally do right away.
Daily tasks like cooking or errands went as planned.
I occasionally misplaced small things like keys or notes.
Conversations at home felt natural and easy.
I sometimes repeated myself or double-checked simple points.
Sleep or downtime usually refreshed me.
On some mornings, I didnâ€™t feel fully recharged.
Routine home activities felt manageable.
At times I relied more on reminders or lists.
I had energy left for optional plans or hobbies.
I sometimes put off small tasks until later.
