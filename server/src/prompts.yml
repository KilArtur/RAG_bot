  I'm conducting a survey to assess your psychological and cognitive load using the Likert method.

  Two subscales (10+10 Likert items, rating 1–7)

  Use the last 5 days as your reference frame. Rate each statement on a scale from 1 to 7, where:
  1 - strongly disagree
  2 - disagree
  3 - somewhat disagree
  4 - neutral
  5 - somewhat agree
  6 - agree
  7 - strongly agree

  If you want to exit the survey, write "stop survey".

  {question}

  Please provide only a number from 1 to 7.

clarify_answer: |
  Could you provide a more detailed answer? This would help me better understand your needs and create a more accurate plan.
  If you want to stop the survey, write "stop survey".

evaluate_answer_quality: |
  Evaluate whether this user's answer is meaningful and sufficient for understanding their situation.

  Question: {question}
  User's answer: {answer}

  The answer should be:
  - Meaningful (not "yes", "no", "I don't know")
  - Related to the asked question
  - Don't require overly detailed responses
  - User's answer can be negative
  - If user's health-related answer is negative, you should consider it complete because they have no health problems, as long as they don't use uncertainty words like: "probably", "maybe", "most likely"
  - User's answer can be short, the main thing is that it answers the question asked

  Answer only "YES" if the answer is suitable, or "NO" if you need to ask again.

evaluate_answer_quality_employee: |
  Evaluate whether this user's Likert scale answer is valid for the cognitive load assessment.

  Question: {question}
  User's answer: {answer}

  The answer should be:
  - A single number from 1 to 7
  - No additional text or explanations required
  - Numbers like "5", "3", "7" are acceptable
  - Text like "пять", "three", or explanatory text should be marked as invalid

  Answer only "YES" if the answer is a valid Likert scale response (1-7), or "NO" if you need to ask again.

generate_final_plan: |
  Based on the user's answers, create a detailed individual plan for transitioning to vegetarianism.
  
  Scenario: {scenario_name}
  
  User's answers:
  {answers_summary}
  
  Create a personalized step-by-step plan that considers:
  - User's motivation
  - Their health and restrictions
  - Lifestyle and living conditions
  - Budget possibilities
  
  The plan should be practical, realistic and contain specific recommendations for:
  - Gradual transition to plant-based nutrition
  - Ensuring all necessary nutrients
  - Planning shopping and meal preparation
  - Overcoming possible difficulties
  
  Structure the answer by weeks/stages with specific actions.

error_complete_scenario: |
  Unfortunately, an error occurred while creating a personalized plan.
            
  General recommendations for transitioning to vegetarianism:
  • Start gradually - replace one meat dish per day with a plant-based one
  • Include legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans) as a protein source
  • Add nuts and seeds for healthy fats
  • Eat a variety of vegetables and fruits
  • Consider taking vitamin B12 supplements
  • Consult a doctor before making radical dietary changes

  Try requesting a personalized plan later.

trigger_prompt_vegans: |
  Based on the user's response, determine whether they express a direct desire to become vegetarian, i.e., to give up eating meat.
  Expressing desire means they write that they want to become vegan or ask to create a plan.
  If the user asks to talk about veganism, that's not a direct desire. Direct desire is when the user's message can be converted to the sentence "I want to become vegetarian".
  If the user asks something about vegetarianism, immediately return "NO".


  User's message: {user_message}

  Answer only "YES" if the answer is suitable, or "NO" if the user did not express a desire to transition to vegetarianism.

trigger_prompt_employee: |
  Based on the user's response, determine whether they express a direct desire to assess their psychological and mental load.
  Expressing desire means they ask to evaluate their cognitive load, mental stress, work-life balance, or ask for help with workload assessment.
  Keywords that indicate this desire: "assess load", "psychological load", "cognitive load", "mental load", "work stress", "burnout", "work-life balance", "evaluate stress", "mental fatigue", "workload assessment".
  If the user just mentions stress without asking for assessment, return "NO".

  User's message: {user_message}

  Answer only "YES" if the user wants cognitive load assessment, or "NO" if they did not express this desire.

generate_final_plan_employee: |
  Analyze the user's cognitive load assessment results and provide practical recommendations for reducing psychological and mental load.

  Scenario: {scenario_name}

  User's Likert scale responses (1-7 scale, last 5 days):
  {answers_summary}

  IMPORTANT: Analyze responses following the Cognitive Load Detection Framework methodology:
  - Questions 1-10: Work load (Work subscale)
  - Questions 11-20: Home load (Home subscale)
  - Baseline questions (odd numbers): low scores indicate high load
  - Trigger questions (even numbers): high scores indicate high load

  Create a personalized analysis and recommendations:

  1. **COGNITIVE LOAD ASSESSMENT:**
     - Analyze work load (questions 1-10)
     - Analyze home load (questions 11-20)
     - Determine overall load level: low/medium/high

  2. **IDENTIFIED PROBLEM AREAS:**
     - Specify concrete areas with increased load
     - Explain the connection between responses and real problems

  3. **PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:**
     - Work load management techniques
     - Recovery and rest strategies
     - Efficiency improvement methods
     - Stress reduction techniques

  4. **ACTION PLAN:**
     - Immediate actions (first 1-2 weeks)
     - Medium-term changes (1-2 months)
     - Long-term strategies (3+ months)

  The response should be in English, practical and applicable in real life.

  Unfortunately, an error occurred while creating a personalized cognitive load analysis.

  General recommendations for reducing psychological and mental load:

  **Work Environment:**
  • Use the Pomodoro Technique (25 min work + 5 min break)
  • Structure tasks by priority (Eisenhower Matrix)
  • Take regular breaks every 1-2 hours
  • Minimize multitasking

  **Home Environment:**
  • Establish boundaries between work and personal life
  • Practice relaxation techniques (meditation, breathing exercises)
  • Ensure quality sleep (7-9 hours)
  • Engage in regular physical activity
