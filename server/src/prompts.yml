  - Related to the asked question
  - Don't require overly detailed responses

  - If user's health-related answer is negative, you should consider it complete because they have no health problems, as long as they don't use uncertainty words like: "probably", "maybe", "most likely"
  - User's answer can be short, the main thing is that it answers the question asked
  
  Answer only "YES" if the answer is suitable, or "NO" if you need to ask again.

error_complete_scenario: |
  Unfortunately, an error occurred while creating a personalized plan.
            
  General recommendations for transitioning to vegetarianism:
  • Start gradually - replace one meat dish per day with a plant-based one
  • Include legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans) as a protein source
  • Add nuts and seeds for healthy fats
  • Eat a variety of vegetables and fruits
  • Consider taking vitamin B12 supplements
  • Consult a doctor before making radical dietary changes

  Try requesting a personalized plan later.

trigger_prompt: |
  Based on the user's response, determine whether they express a direct desire to become vegetarian, i.e., to give up eating meat.
  Expressing desire means they write that they want to become vegan or ask to create a plan. If they say they're only thinking about becoming vegan, that's not a direct desire.
  If the user asks to talk about veganism, that's not a direct desire. Direct desire is when the user's message can be converted to the sentence "I want to become vegetarian".
  If the user wrote that they're thinking about becoming vegan, don't create any plans for them, just support them, briefly explain why it's a good idea and warn about risks, suggest the user write "I want to become vegetarian" so you can conduct a survey and create an individual plan.
  If the user asks something about vegetarianism, immediately return "NO".
  
  
  User's message: {user_message}
  
  Answer only "YES" if the answer is suitable, or "NO" if the user did not express a desire to transition to vegetarianism.
