  I can help. First, I'll personalize advice using your Conscience IQ (CIQ) score‚Äîa quick, 2‚Äì3 minute check.
  It uses your responses plus optional biometrics (blink rate, pupil dilation, HRV via wearable, and response speed).
  ‚Ä¢ Your data stays private and is used only to tailor support.
  Would you like to continue?

  Hi üëã It's time for your weekly Conscience IQ check-in. This will only take a few minutes. Ready to begin?

clarify_answer: |
  Please provide only a number from 1 to 7 according to the scale instructions in the question.

  If you want to stop the survey, write "stop survey".

evaluate_answer_quality: |
  Evaluate whether this user's rating answer is valid for the DARI assessment.

  Question: {question}
  User's answer: {answer}

  The answer should be:
  - A single number from 1 to 7
  - No additional text or explanations required
  - Numbers like "5", "3", "7" are acceptable
  - Text like "five", "three", or explanatory text should be marked as invalid

  Answer only "YES" if the answer is a valid rating (1-7), or "NO" if you need to ask again.

  Evaluate whether this user's Likert scale answer is valid for the cognitive load assessment.

  Question: {question}
  User's answer: {answer}

  The answer should be:
  - A single number from 1 to 7
  - No additional text or explanations required
  - Numbers like "5", "3", "7" are acceptable
  - Text like "–ø—è—Ç—å", "three", or explanatory text should be marked as invalid

  Answer only "YES" if the answer is a valid Likert scale response (1-7), or "NO" if you need to ask again.

  Analyze the user's DARI (Dietary Adaptation Readiness Index) assessment and create a personalized vegan transition plan.
  You need to very briefly instruct the user and not give him a 3-step reasoning, and then offer a diet for the user. Here is one answer option: 
  "Your CIQ score is 4.8/10, which shows you may be under some stress right now. That doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt make good choices ‚Äî it just means it‚Äôs best to go step by step and make sure you feel supported."

  Scenario: {scenario_name}

  User's DARI scale responses (1-7 scale):
  {answers_summary}

  IMPORTANT: Calculate and interpret the DARI score according to the framework:

  **STEP 1 - REVERSE SCORING:**
  Question 3 (Item 8): RS = 8 - raw score (reverse score the temporal sacrifice question)

  **STEP 2 - CALCULATE SUBSCALE SCORES (0-100):**
  - TA (Temporal Agency): Questions 1, 2 - future orientation
  - MR (Moral Reasoning): Question 4 - ethical consistency
  - NA (Negative Affect): Question 5 - emotional regulation
  - CF (Cognitive Flexibility): Question 3 (reversed) - adaptability
  - PC (Post-Revision Consolidation): Not assessed in short version
  - VA (Value Adherence): Not assessed in short version

  **STEP 3 - OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**
  Determine readiness level based on responses:
  - High readiness (most responses 5-7): Strong likelihood of successful transition
  - Moderate readiness (mixed responses): Manageable transition with support
  - Low readiness (most responses 1-3): Consider staged approach

  **CREATE PERSONALIZED PLAN:**

  1. **STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION:**
     - Week 1-2: Initial changes based on readiness
     - Week 3-4: Progressive implementation
     - Month 2+: Long-term sustainability

  2. **SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS:**
     - Address identified weak areas
     - Suggest specific resources and techniques
     - Monitor and adjustment strategies

  The response should be in English, evidence-based, and practical for real-world implementation.

  Unfortunately, an error occurred while creating a personalized plan.
            
  General recommendations for transitioning to vegetarianism:
  ‚Ä¢ Start gradually - replace one meat dish per day with a plant-based one
  ‚Ä¢ Include legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans) as a protein source
  ‚Ä¢ Add nuts and seeds for healthy fats
  ‚Ä¢ Eat a variety of vegetables and fruits
  ‚Ä¢ Consider taking vitamin B12 supplements
  ‚Ä¢ Consult a doctor before making radical dietary changes

  Try requesting a personalized plan later.

trigger_prompt_vegans: |
  Based on the user's response, determine whether they express a direct desire to become vegetarian, i.e., to give up eating meat.
  Expressing desire means they write that they want to become vegan or ask to create a plan.
  If the user asks to talk about veganism, that's not a direct desire. Direct desire is when the user's message can be converted to the sentence "I want to become vegetarian".
  If the user asks something about vegetarianism, immediately return "NO".


  User's message: {user_message}

  Answer only "YES" if the answer is suitable, or "NO" if the user did not express a desire to transition to vegetarianism.

trigger_prompt_employee: |
  Based on the user's response, determine whether they express a direct desire to assess their psychological and mental load.
  Expressing desire means they ask to evaluate their cognitive load, mental stress, work-life balance, or ask for help with workload assessment.
  Keywords that indicate this desire: "assess load", "psychological load", "cognitive load", "mental load", "work stress", "burnout", "work-life balance", "evaluate stress", "mental fatigue", "workload assessment".
  If the user just mentions stress without asking for assessment, return "NO".

  User's message: {user_message}

  Answer only "YES" if the user wants cognitive load assessment, or "NO" if they did not express this desire.

generate_final_plan_employee: |
  Analyze the user's cognitive load assessment results and provide practical recommendations for reducing psychological and mental load.

  Scenario: {scenario_name}

  User's Likert scale responses (1-7 scale, last 5 days):
  {answers_summary}

  IMPORTANT: Analyze responses following the Cognitive Load Detection Framework methodology:
  - Questions 1-10: Work load (Work subscale)
  - Questions 11-20: Home load (Home subscale)
  - Baseline questions (odd numbers): low scores indicate high load
  - Trigger questions (even numbers): high scores indicate high load

  Create a personalized analysis and recommendations:

  1. **COGNITIVE LOAD ASSESSMENT:**
     - Analyze work load (questions 1-10)
     - Analyze home load (questions 11-20)
     - Determine overall load level: low/medium/high

  2. **IDENTIFIED PROBLEM AREAS:**
     - Specify concrete areas with increased load
     - Explain the connection between responses and real problems

  3. **PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:**
     - Work load management techniques
     - Recovery and rest strategies
     - Efficiency improvement methods
     - Stress reduction techniques

  4. **ACTION PLAN:**
     - Immediate actions (first 1-2 weeks)
     - Medium-term changes (1-2 months)
     - Long-term strategies (3+ months)

  The response should be in English, practical and applicable in real life.

  Unfortunately, an error occurred while creating a personalized cognitive load analysis.

  General recommendations for reducing psychological and mental load:

  **Work Environment:**
  ‚Ä¢ Use the Pomodoro Technique (25 min work + 5 min break)
  ‚Ä¢ Structure tasks by priority (Eisenhower Matrix)
  ‚Ä¢ Take regular breaks every 1-2 hours
  ‚Ä¢ Minimize multitasking

  **Home Environment:**
  ‚Ä¢ Establish boundaries between work and personal life
  ‚Ä¢ Practice relaxation techniques (meditation, breathing exercises)
  ‚Ä¢ Ensure quality sleep (7-9 hours)
  ‚Ä¢ Engage in regular physical activity

  - Or simply "yes"/"no" to indicate if you want to continue

  Would you like to proceed with the assessment?

check_user_consent: |
  Analyze the user's response to determine if they want to continue with the assessment.

  User's response: {answer}

  The user was asked if they want to continue with a CIQ assessment. Look for signs of:

  AGREEMENT (return "AGREED"):
  - "yes", "sure", "okay", "let's go", "continue", "proceed"
  - Numbers 4-7 (moderate to strong willingness)
  - Any positive indication to proceed

  DECLINE (return "DECLINED"):
  - "no", "not now", "maybe later", "I'm not ready"
  - Numbers 1-3 (low willingness)
  - Any negative indication or postponement

  UNCLEAR (return "UNCLEAR"):
  - Confusing or ambiguous responses
  - Questions instead of answers
  - Responses that don't clearly indicate yes or no

  Answer only "AGREED", "DECLINED", or "UNCLEAR".
