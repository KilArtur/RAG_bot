  I can help. First, I'll personalize advice using your Conscience IQ (CIQ) score‚Äîa quick, 2‚Äì3 minute check.
  It uses your responses plus optional biometrics (blink rate, pupil dilation, HRV via wearable, and response speed).
  ‚Ä¢ Your data stays private and is used only to tailor support.
  Would you like to continue?

  Hi üëã It's time for your weekly Conscience IQ check-in. This will only take a few minutes. Ready to begin?

clarify_answer: |
  Please provide only a number from 1 to 7 according to the scale instructions in the question.

  If you want to stop the survey, write "stop survey".

evaluate_answer_quality: |
  Evaluate whether this user's rating answer is valid for the DARI assessment.

  Question: {question}
  User's answer: {answer}

  The answer should be:
  - A single number from 1 to 7
  - No additional text or explanations required
  - Numbers like "5", "3", "7" are acceptable
  - Text like "five", "three", or explanatory text should be marked as invalid

  Answer only "YES" if the answer is a valid rating (1-7), or "NO" if you need to ask again.

  Create a biometric feedback report for the user's Conscience IQ (CIQ) assessment following this exact format:

  User's responses (1-7 scale):
  {answers_summary}

  IMPORTANT: Follow this exact structure:

  Thank you for completing the session. Here is your biometric feedback.

  (Questionnaire has hidden details behind drop down menus)

  For each question, show:
  Q[number]. [Insert the actual question text from answers_summary]
  ‚ñæ View biometric insights
  [Generate realistic biometric data based on the user's response (1-7 scale)]
  Interpretation: [Provide meaningful interpretation based on the response]

  **Biometric data generation rules:**
  - For responses 1-2 (low): Show signs of stress/discomfort (higher pupil dilation, irregular HRV, changes in blink rate)
  - For responses 3-4 (neutral): Show balanced/neutral biometric readings
  - For responses 5-7 (high): Show positive engagement (stable readings, positive HRV, focused attention)

  **After all questions, end with:**
  I can now use Agent Mode to safely browse the internet and identify support groups, resources, or communities that align with your results.
  Would you like me to:
  Search for online support groups (forums, guided programs, communities).
  Search for local groups in your region.
  Or skip this step for now?

  The response should be in English and follow the exact format from the template.

error_complete_scenario: |
  Unfortunately, an error occurred while creating a personalized plan.
            
  General recommendations for transitioning to vegetarianism:
  ‚Ä¢ Start gradually - replace one meat dish per day with a plant-based one
  ‚Ä¢ Include legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans) as a protein source
  ‚Ä¢ Add nuts and seeds for healthy fats
  ‚Ä¢ Eat a variety of vegetables and fruits
  ‚Ä¢ Consider taking vitamin B12 supplements
  ‚Ä¢ Consult a doctor before making radical dietary changes

  Try requesting a personalized plan later.

trigger_prompt_vegans: |
  Based on the user's response, determine whether they express a direct desire to become vegetarian, i.e., to give up eating meat.
  Expressing desire means they write that they want to become vegan or ask to create a plan.
  If the user asks to talk about veganism, that's not a direct desire. Direct desire is when the user's message can be converted to the sentence "I want to become vegetarian".
  If the user asks something about vegetarianism, immediately return "NO".


  User's message: {user_message}

  Answer only "YES" if the answer is suitable, or "NO" if the user did not express a desire to transition to vegetarianism.

trigger_prompt_employee: |
  Based on the user's response, determine whether they express a direct desire to assess their psychological and mental load.
  Expressing desire means they ask to evaluate their cognitive load, mental stress, work-life balance, or ask for help with workload assessment.
  Keywords that indicate this desire: "assess load", "psychological load", "cognitive load", "mental load", "work stress", "burnout", "work-life balance", "evaluate stress", "mental fatigue", "workload assessment".
  If the user just mentions stress without asking for assessment, return "NO".

  User's message: {user_message}

  Answer only "YES" if the user wants cognitive load assessment, or "NO" if they did not express this desire.

generate_final_plan_employee: |
  Analyze the user's cognitive load assessment results and provide practical recommendations for reducing psychological and mental load.

  Scenario: {scenario_name}

  User's Likert scale responses (1-7 scale, last 5 days):
  {answers_summary}

  IMPORTANT: Analyze responses following the Cognitive Load Detection Framework methodology:
  - Questions 1-10: Work load (Work subscale)
  - Questions 11-20: Home load (Home subscale)
  - Baseline questions (odd numbers): low scores indicate high load
  - Trigger questions (even numbers): high scores indicate high load

  Create a personalized analysis and recommendations:

  1. **COGNITIVE LOAD ASSESSMENT:**
     - Analyze work load (questions 1-10)
     - Analyze home load (questions 11-20)
     - Determine overall load level: low/medium/high

  2. **IDENTIFIED PROBLEM AREAS:**
     - Specify concrete areas with increased load
     - Explain the connection between responses and real problems

  3. **PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:**
     - Work load management techniques
     - Recovery and rest strategies
     - Efficiency improvement methods
     - Stress reduction techniques

  4. **ACTION PLAN:**
     - Immediate actions (first 1-2 weeks)
     - Medium-term changes (1-2 months)
     - Long-term strategies (3+ months)

  The response should be in English, practical and applicable in real life.

  Unfortunately, an error occurred while creating a personalized cognitive load analysis.

  General recommendations for reducing psychological and mental load:

  **Work Environment:**
  ‚Ä¢ Use the Pomodoro Technique (25 min work + 5 min break)
  ‚Ä¢ Structure tasks by priority (Eisenhower Matrix)
  ‚Ä¢ Take regular breaks every 1-2 hours
  ‚Ä¢ Minimize multitasking

  **Home Environment:**
  ‚Ä¢ Establish boundaries between work and personal life
  ‚Ä¢ Practice relaxation techniques (meditation, breathing exercises)
  ‚Ä¢ Ensure quality sleep (7-9 hours)
  ‚Ä¢ Engage in regular physical activity

  Try requesting a personalized analysis later.

  3 - somewhat disagree
  4 - neutral
  5 - somewhat agree
  6 - agree
  7 - strongly agree

clarify_consent_answer: |
  I need to understand whether you'd like to continue with the assessment.

  Please respond with:
  - A number from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very strongly)
  - Or simply "yes"/"no" to indicate if you want to continue

  Would you like to proceed with the assessment?

check_user_consent: |
  Analyze the user's response to determine if they want to continue with the assessment.

  User's response: {answer}

  The user was asked if they want to continue with a CIQ assessment. Look for signs of:

  AGREEMENT (return "AGREED"):
  - "yes", "sure", "okay", "let's go", "continue", "proceed"
  - Numbers 4-7 (moderate to strong willingness)
  - Any positive indication to proceed

  DECLINE (return "DECLINED"):
  - "no", "not now", "maybe later", "I'm not ready"
  - Numbers 1-3 (low willingness)
  - Any negative indication or postponement

  UNCLEAR (return "UNCLEAR"):
  - Confusing or ambiguous responses
  - Questions instead of answers
  - Responses that don't clearly indicate yes or no

  Answer only "AGREED", "DECLINED", or "UNCLEAR".
